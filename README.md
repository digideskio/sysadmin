Random Sysadmin Stuff

LPAD (LaunchPad) is a framework for running bulk procedures on one or more
servers via root ssh keys.  Useful for automation procedures and/or maintaining
standard configurations.  This is mostly a stop-gap if you don't have a
configuration management system in place.

The other scripts are just a miscellaneous group of things I have found
useful at one time or another.  Most of these were created to serve a single
purpose and some have been quite useful over time.  I do not claim to have
any level of robustness on any of this and, in case it isn't obvious, use
at your own risk.
